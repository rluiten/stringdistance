module StringDistance exposing

{-| A library to calculate a metric indicating the string distance between two strings.

This library was extracted from the Elm implementation of mailcheck <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rluiten/mailcheck/latest>.

The `lcs` and `lcsLimit` functions are more general and support more than just
Char as list elements.

{-| Longest Common Subsequence

This is a simple implementation and would benefit from memoization if
performance is a problem. It does not limit look ahead
which can be very costly see lcsLimit for a limited look ahead version.

Warning this gets very slow very quickly with increases in list lengths even
17 character lists can cause things to bog down.

This implementation is based on [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Longest\_common\_subsequence#Haskell](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence#Haskell)

{-| Return function which returns lcs with limited look ahead.

Warning maxLookAhead quickly makes the returned function costly stay
below 8 if you want responsiveness.
